# GenCon-Event-Parser
Parse GenCon Event List, correct duplicate listings, and build a time table of events

This is a work in progress and is not intended to be user friendly.
1. The xlsx file frm https://www.gencon.com/gen-con-indy/how-to-find-events needs to be downloaded and exported as a CSV (not UTF-8).  In the future this script will read CSV files.
2. There's no input option.
3. The duplicate event detection needs tuning/work

The output will display a "schedule" of events over the course of the week to help with planning.

I'll use my own decision making matrix combined with this output to build my wishlist.
